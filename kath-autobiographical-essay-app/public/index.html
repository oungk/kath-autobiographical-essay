      <h1>On being lucky</h1>
      <h4>(and becoming an engineer-data-journalist)</h4>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row d-flex justify-content-center">
        <div class="col-md-6">

          <p>In the back of my middle school’s 2016-17 yearbook there is a Letter from the Editor that I wrote at age thirteen. “I feel so lucky,” I’d written, about the opportunity to lead coverage of that school year as Editor-In-Chief.</p>

          <p>These days, I’m more focused on the realms of data journalism, news engineering and freelance reporting, but I continue to feel incredibly lucky to be a journalist. This profession rouses my curiosity and challenges my problem solving skills, but most of all, it is a privilege — to be let into the lives of my sources and to be trusted by my audience to explain and record history as it occurs.</p>

          <h4>Covering my community</h4>

          <p>After a school shooting occurred at ​​Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018, I joined a group of student reporters hired by the Since Parkland project. For a year, I wrote obituaries of youth killed by gun violence, and through meeting their family members, friends and teachers, learned about each of their vibrant and complex lives. </p>
        
          <div id="graph" alt="Beeswarm baby."></div>

          <p>I find there are new stories to tell everywhere I go. At my high school, I learned about racist remarks made against Chinese students at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and documented the aftermath in an Op-Doc for the New York Times. During driving lessons with my dad, I noticed when “community fridges” started popping up around Miami and reported on this phenomenon for Vox. </p>

          <p>I joined The Vanderbilt Hustler in college and have since written about on-campus deaths of construction workers, the expulsion of The Tennessee Three, the Love Rising LGBTQ+ benefit concert and more.</p>
        
          <h4>Discovering data</h4>

          <p>As a news consumer, I’ve always been amazed by in-depth data reporting, beautiful graphics and interactive news designs. I attended an office hour session hosted by The Washington Post’s News Engineering Team in 2022, and after hearing from staffers like Dana Cassidy and Emma Baker, my dream of becoming an engineer-journalist crystalized in my mind. I declared a major in computer science and minor in data science that semester.</p>

          <p>That spring, I advocated for The Hustler to start a Data Section and eventually took on the role of Data Editor. </p>
        
          <div id="graph" alt="Time series."></div>

          <p>As I tell every new Data staffer during training, I believe data is essential to journalism: it gives context, explains complicated concepts and quantifies systemic issues and trends; it is creative, artistic, and fun!</p>

          <h4>Looking forward</h4>

          <p>Right now, I’m learning new skills by practicing D3 and finishing a scraper for a story at The Vanderbilt Hustler, while hosting weekly Data section workshops about skills like FOIAing and cleaning datasets in R and Python. As I look toward post-grad life myself, I know I want to spend the rest of my life learning, teaching and telling stories.</p>
