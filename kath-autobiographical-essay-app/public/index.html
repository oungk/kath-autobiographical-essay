            <h1>On being lucky</h1>
            <h4>(and becoming an engineer-data-journalist)</h4>
          </div>

          <p>In the back of my middle school’s 2016-17 yearbook there is a Letter from the Editor that I wrote at age thirteen. “I feel so lucky,” I’d written, about the opportunity to lead coverage of that school year as Editor-In-Chief.</p>

          <p>These days, I’m more focused on the realms of data journalism, news engineering and freelance reporting, but I continue to feel incredibly lucky to be a journalist. This profession rouses my curiosity and challenges my problem solving skills, but most of all, it is a privilege — to be let into the lives of my sources and to be trusted by my audience to explain and record history as it occurs.</p>

          <h4>Covering my community</h4>

          <p>I’ve worked as a professional freelance journalist since the age of 15. My first published work was for the Since Parkland project, where I wrote obituaries of youth killed by gun violence in the year after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting. In high school, I filmed an Op-Doc for The New York Times about coronavirus-related racism and reported on community fridges for Vox.</p>

          </div>

          <p>I find there are new stories to tell everywhere I go. I joined The Vanderbilt Hustler the summer before my freshman year of college and have since explored almost every section offered by the paper; I even created a new Data section along the way!</p>

          <p>
            I’ve highlighted wrongdoings (such as 
            <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2022/01/10/vanderbilt-among-16-top-universities-sued-for-allegedly-colluding-to-limit-financial-aid/">financial aid collusion</a> 
            and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2022/02/23/construction-worker-found-dead-on-rothschild-college-construction-site/">construction worker deaths</a>), 
            chronicled breaking news (such as the expulsion of 
            <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/07/the-nation-is-watching-students-lead-protests-as-rep-justin-jones-and-rep-justin-pearson-are-expelled/">the Tennessee Three</a>), 
            contextualized major events with data (such as this explainer of 
            <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/04/17/tennessee-gun-laws-what-you-need-to-know/">Tennessee gun laws</a> 
            and this explainer on 
            <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/09/02/how-vanderbilts-kirkland-hall-sit-in-and-encampment-influenced-last-semesters-wave-of-pro-palestine-protests/">Palestine protests</a>), 
            honored the dead (such as obituaries of 
            <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2022/12/14/vanderbilt-community-family-members-remember-sophomore-emily-sotelo/">students</a> 
            and <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/11/23/a-true-leader-community-members-celebrate-life-of-staff-member-olivia-parrish/">staff</a>), 
            and produced plenty of feel-good, joyous stories, too (such as 
            <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2023/03/23/juxtaposition-of-jubilance-and-fear-love-rising-concert-raises-funds-for-lgbtq-organizations-in-tennessee-matched-up-to-100000/">concerts</a>, 
            <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2024/02/20/datamatchs-algorithmic-quest-for-campus-chemistry/">matchmaking</a>, and 
            <a href="https://vanderbilthustler.com/2022/01/22/mutual-aid-initiatives-relaunched-on-campus/">mutual aid</a>). 
            Journalism helps me understand, contextualize, and process the world around me, and I seek to do the same for my audiences.
          </p>

          <h4>Discovering data</h4>

          <p>As a news consumer, I’ve always been amazed by in-depth data reporting, beautiful graphics and interactive news designs. After attending the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR), my dream of becoming an engineer-journalist crystalized in my mind. I declared a major in computer science and minor in data science that year.</p>

          <p>During my sophomore year, I advocated for The Hustler to start a Data Section and eventually took on the role of Data Editor.</p>

            <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/19671733"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/19671733/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="chart visualization" /></noscript></div>
          </div>

          <p>As I tell every new Data staffer during training, I believe data is essential to journalism: it gives context, explains complicated concepts and quantifies systemic issues and trends; it is creative, artistic, and fun!</p>

          <h4>Looking forward</h4>

          <p>I spent my summers in college immersed in the intersection of data and journalism. I worked at the Latin American Public Opinion Project as a data research assistant, then at the Indianapolis Star as an investigative data reporting intern, then at The New York Times as a data analyst.</p>

          <p>I am currently an Election Analytics contractor at The New York Times, which will continue after graduation until June. In June, I will start as a Software Engineering Intern on the New York Times Games Discovery team. On the side, I’m sharpening my D3 data visualization skills and pitching freelance pieces about everything from online events gambling to political puppetry. As I look toward post-grad life, I know I want to spend the rest of my life learning, teaching and telling stories.</p>
